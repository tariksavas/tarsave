# Tarsave - Save and Load System

Tarsave provides a powerful system for handling save and load operations in your Unity projects. It enables you to securely save and load user progress, settings, and other important data. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Tarsave is a highly useful and easy-to-integrate tool for your projects.

With Tarsaveâ€™s autosave feature, you can automatically save user progress at regular intervals. This minimizes the risk of data loss and enhances the user experience.

Tarsave supports AES encryption, ensuring that your data is securely protected. The saved data is encrypted with a strong algorithm, keeping sensitive information safe at all times.

Additionally, Tarsave includes an automatic backup feature that creates backups with every save operation. Both the save files and backup files are stored in `Application.persistentDataPath`, ensuring that your data is always protected, and you can easily restore previous versions in case of any issues.

Tarsave now also supports data compression, reducing the size of saved files without sacrificing performance. This is especially beneficial for large datasets, as it optimizes storage usage while maintaining quick save and load times.

Finally, Tarsave is designed with optimization in mind, ensuring high performance. Save and load operations are fast and efficient, ensuring smooth gameplay and user interactions.

Manage your data securely, efficiently, and without loss with Tarsave!
